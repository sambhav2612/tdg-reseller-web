The drive from Shillong to Dawki is a thrilling experience passing through deep gorges and ravines. The cool, moist air brushes over your face will refresh and revitalizes you on your way to Dawki.\n\nThe crystal clear Umngot River of Dawki is a major attraction that marks the natural separation between the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills. Dawki sets the ideal tourist spot for camping and adventure water sports.  The river in Dawki is the site for a boat race that is held in March-April, but even otherwise, sightseeing at this large emerald-green serpent threading its way through the hills, with fishermen’s boats dotting its surface, right into the plains of Bangladesh, is a sight whose majesty echoes long after you leave it.",

Its women friendly, their food is great, you dont have to worry about anything and their itinerary is just perfectly suitable for all.",

Seeking my requirements and providing exactly what I need in just couple of hours helped me save so much time and effort. The booking experience was so easy that I was almost certain that I am going to have a great time on my trek even before starting.I exactly got what I was promised throughout the trek- Starting from the time I got down from the bus at McLeod bus Stand to the time I finished my Trek. The Guide, The On trek assistance, The food, The arrangements- Everything was superfine. I am glad that I chose Travel d'globe for organizing my trek and it was all worth it. Its A great guide to your travel. Take care of your budget and your interests at the same time. Good goin!!",

Seeking my requirements and providing exactly what I need in just couple of hours helped me save so much time and effort. The booking experience was so easy that I was almost certain that I am going to have a great time on my trek even before starting.I exactly got what I was promised throughout the trek- Starting from the time I got down from the bus at McLeod bus Stand to the time I finished my Trek. The Guide, The On trek assistance, The food, The arrangements- Everything was superfine. I am glad that I chose Travel d'globe for organizing my trek and it was all worth it. Its A great guide to your travel. Take care of your budget and your interests at the same time. Good goin!!",

Seeking my requirements and providing exactly what I need in just couple of hours helped me save so much time and effort. The booking experience was so easy that I was almost certain that I am going to have a great time on my trek even before starting.I exactly got what I was promised throughout the trek- Starting from the time I got down from the bus at McLeod bus Stand to the time I finished my Trek. The Guide, The On trek assistance, The food, The arrangements- Everything was superfine. I am glad that I chose Travel d'globe for organizing my trek and it was all worth it. Its A great guide to your travel. Take care of your budget and your interests at the same time. Good goin!!",

            "review":"Triund- My first trekking experience with travel d'globe was just great.I Believe making things simple is something that is missed by most of the travel organizers and travel d'globe has nailed it. Seeking my requirements and providing exactly what I need in just couple of hours helped me save so much time and effort. The booking experience was so easy that I was almost certain that I am going to have a great time on my trek even before starting.I exactly got what I was promised throughout the trek- Starting from the time I got down from the bus at McLeod bus Stand to the time I finished my Trek. The Guide, The On trek assistance, The food, The arrangements- Everything was superfine. I am glad that I chose Travel d'globe for organizing my trek and it was all worth it. Its A great guide to your travel. Take care of your budget and your interests at the same time. Good goin!!"

            "review":"From the start of the trip till the end, the staff was so polite, cooperative and caring. It never felt like we are availing any service, they took such good care of our entire group. The chaning room in hotel, trekking, food, camping, everything went really well. I'd like to specially thank Anuj(our trek guide) for all the hard work he put in for making us feel so much at ease during our entire trek and camping. And also to Himanshu(from traveldglobe) for making this possible in such a less time and giving us valuable memories of that trip. Would really recommend everyone to go for this without any concerns. Its women friendly, their food is great, you dont have to worry about anything and their itinerary is just perfectly suitable for all."

            "review":"My first ever trekking experience to 'Parashar Lake' with the trek lead Himanshu from 'trave d'globe' was full of excitement and adventure. Myself not on a very healthy and fit state, got lot of support from Himanshu to complete the trip. Parashar Lake in a small heaven on the mountains, of course have the inherent magic, beauty and enchanting mystical qualities of the Himalayas. Wish all the best to Himanshu for a great career ahead. Of course he is lucky to feel the magical Himalayas very often. Kudos !!!"

            "review":"We opted for a trek with Travel d'globe to Triund. We were quite skeptical before taking the trek as for most of us this was our first camping exp. But kudos to the team and to our Guide Sahil whose hospitality makes it a quite memorable one. He guided us thoroughly throughout the trek, arranged for the stay and pampered us the way we require :). They also make available one room for one of our trek member as he was not able to make it to the trek. Thumbs up to the nice team work, will really look forward to the next trip with us. Do update about your other treks/trips. Cheers!!! Highly recommended ☺"
